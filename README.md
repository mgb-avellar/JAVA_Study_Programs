# JAVA_Study_Programs

Hello, the programs you find here are the ones I coded while studying JAVA from Prof. Nelio Alves' course hosted at UDEMY (https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/). [The language of the course is Brazilian Portuguese]

Prof. Nelio has a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's, and a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from the Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil.

He is a professor at Instituto Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Minas Gerais, Brazil. His UDEMY JAVA course is highly rated (4.8) and certified 22,124 students. 


You will find seven modules containing numerous codes whose names I parameterize by date, time, and type as follows: 

date: yyyymmdd

time: XXhYYm

type: EX for examples given during the lectures and EXERCICIOS for the proposed exercises

A typical label would be 20210218_20h00m_EX_matrices, meaning that I coded this example at 8 p.m. on 18th February 2021.

The purpose of these codes is for my studies only. You are free to check on them, but keep in mind that the examples (labeled with EX) are from prof. Nelio's classes (with some small programming style differences).

Enjoy!

Hugs
